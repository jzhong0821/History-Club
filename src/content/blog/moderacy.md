## Where is the Moderate voice on campus affairs?

Here’s how the American political system works: conservatives on the right defend the status quo or advocate a return to an earlier era; progressives on the left push for reform and envision a different future. Given America’s history of laissez-faire economics and liberalist tradition, the default political posture, or status quo, leans right. Conservatives typically align with older versions of capitalism; progressives, with newer, more socialist-leaning adaptations. The electoral system functions as a balancing mechanism, resetting the national direction every four years.

Campus politics should, in theory, reflect a similar push and pull. A new student government proposes policies; the student body evaluates them and signals approval through democratic support. But on this campus, that middle ground, the moderate voice, has all but disappeared.
Take a look at how policy change usually happens. The ramen bar is a policy almost universally agreed upon to be positive that was introduced by the Wonjin & Lincoln council. But was it ever truly up for discussion? The student body was never given a transparent breakdown: What does it cost to run? What were the trade-offs? Were there alternative uses for that budget?

Now, occasionally, pushback does surface, but only when changes provoke enough dissent to become a minor PR crisis. Earlier this year, the DEI council attempted to rename Lunar New Year to "Asian New Year." The public backlash was fast and widespread, prompting a reversal. The key here is that the dissent only occurred after the announcement. There was no proactive effort to solicit feedback beforehand.

The core problem is this: change is too often implemented without a mechanism for structured disagreement. And structured disagreement requires access to information. Without transparency, disagreement can’t exist, at least not in any meaningful way.

A moderate voice does not mean a PR crisis every time it is heard. For example, a simple, all-school survey prior to major policy changes could allow for the kind of engagement that prevents backlash. This is especially important in areas as sensitive and significant as DEI reform or cultural recognition. In the case of the LNY renaming, it seems reasonable that East Asian students, the group most affected, should have been consulted before any rebranding occurred.

Now, I know firsthand how unwelcome moderate voices can be. It shouldn’t have to be that dissent is tolerated only when it’s loud enough to be heard. The school administration has a responsibility to seek out moderate perspectives, not just react when things boil over.

That means more transparency in student council, more proactive communication from school leadership, and an end to the quiet shaming of dissenting voices.

I may be getting ahead of myself, but I think most students would agree that school spirit, whatever it once was, is lacking. And while Stevenson says it wants to rebuild that spirit, it won't happen unless students are genuinely involved in shaping the community they live in. Students won’t care about the school until they’re given a reason to.
We need a moderate voice on campus affairs, not to block change, but to ask whether change is being made for the right reasons.
