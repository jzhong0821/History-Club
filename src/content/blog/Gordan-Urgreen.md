## Intro

Urban green spaces offer a break from the chaos in bustling cities. These pockets of nature are more than merely aesthetic additions to the cityscape. Greenspaces are vital in enhancing mental health and overall quality of life for urban dwellers.

## Mental Health

The urban environment, characterized by high population density, noise, pollution, and the relentless demands of modern life, can exact a toll on mental health. Unsurprisingly, conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression are prevalent among city populations, being one of the leading causes of the worldwide disease burden, at an estimated global cost of £1.6 trillion per year. In fact, more than 1 in 5 U.S. adults live with a mental illness. Furthermore, these mental health conditions increase the risk for many types of physical health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Unfortunately, the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is wide. However, the presence of urban green spaces provides a valuable antidote.

## Education in Renewable Energy Engineering

A strong education plays a pivotal role in almost every engineering field. In the case of renewable engineering, it means to obtain a degree in disciplines like mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, renewable engineering, or environmental science. These academic pursuits provide the foundational knowledge essential for pursuing this career path.

To truly equip yourself for success in this field, consider furthering your education in specialized areas such as solar and wind power. These additional qualifications can significantly bolster your career prospects.

## Scientific Studies: Living Near Green Spaces

Numerous research studies have shown a clear link between access to green urban areas and enhanced mental well-being. Specifically, significant variations in disease prevalence have been shown when comparing individuals residing in highly green and less green environments, even after accounting for socioeconomic factors (Maas et al, 2009). The presence of nearby green spaces has been found to act as a buffer against life stresses, a trend that has been observed in both an adult population in the Netherlands and a childhood population in rural upstate New York, USA (Wells & Evans, 2003; van den Berg et al, 2010). Furthermore, people who relocate from less green to more green areas have exhibited notably improved mental health during the three years following the move, suggesting a sustained and prompt enhancement (Alcock et al, 2014).

## Physical Activity in Green Spaces

The term 'green exercise' has been coined to describe physical activity in natural settings (Barton et al, 2016). Whether it involves jogging, practicing yoga, or engaging in sports, these green spaces offer a convenient and welcoming environment for exercise. In fact, numerous systematic reviews have revealed a positive relationship between the availability of green spaces and the level of physical activity. People who engage in physical activities within the natural environment at least once a week are associated with a 50% reduced risk of experiencing poor mental health compared to those who do not, and each additional weekly session of physical activity in natural surroundings reduces the risk of poor mental health by an extra 6% (Mitchell et al, 2013).

## Fostering Community

Furthermore, urban green spaces encourage a sense of community. Parks, gardens, and other greenspaces serve as communal spaces for social interactions, which are crucial for mental well-being. These locations bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering a sense of inclusion and reducing social isolation. Even simple, seemingly insignificant activities such as engaging in conversations with neighbors during neighborhood garden events can nurture relationships that play a vital role in maintaining good mental health: “When people are low in social connection—because of isolation, loneliness, or poor-quality relationships—they face an increased risk of premature death,” said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University who studies how relationships affect the body and brain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the impact of urban green spaces on health, both mental and physical, is profound. Access to green spaces can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression, encourage physical activity, and promote a sense of community.
