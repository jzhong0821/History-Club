## Introduction

    Slavery is an incredibly complex and damaging issue with effects that linger even today, and yet most people overlooked it and thought that the U.S. Civil War ended its existence.

## The Myth of the Civil War Ending Slavery

    It is a very common idea to think that the Civil War ended slavery, with the Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment coming out of it. However, some slave owners found ways to get around it and arguably make slavery worse, which is what we will get into in this article.

## Debt Peonage

    One of the more roundabout ways they would do this was through debt peonage. This was a system wherein a person, likely someone who was not very well off, would get arrested, they would be taken to court, get convicted, and then, if the punishment of their crime only involved a fine, they could have payed off their debt via working for the other party in the case. This doesn’t sound too exploitative yet, however, many people found ways to exploit this using completely unfair contracts and convicting people, who were usually black, of ridiculous crimes, such as vagrancy, meaning you didn’t have a job. Continuing on, after the victim finished the amount of work to compensate for the original debt, they were still considered criminals because all the food and housing they were getting during that time period would be added to their debt. This means that, combined with the very low wages, a person with a contract such as this would probably never be able to break free, being forced to spend the rest of their life working, all because of some ridiculous crime carried out by abusive minds.

## Sharecropping

    If you’re thinking this sounds like sharecropping you’d be right, as sharecropping involves someone working on a farm, and their work would pay for their needs. This usually made them fall into debt, and if it didn’t, they weren’t left with a lot of money either. However, the biggest difference between a contract of debt peonage and sharecropping, is that the sharecropper can leave and agree to pay off their debts in some other way, the debt peon can not do that.

## Convict Leasing

    In the years following the Civil War, many companies that relied on slavery were having a tough time keeping up as there were many people now fighting for their rights, and so they worked out agreements with prisons in a system known as convict leasing. This would be where a convict would be in prison, and instead of serving out the rest of their time in that prison, they would be sold out, for a very low price, to anyone that wanted them. If you think it would be okay for a convict to do labor as opposed to using up taxpayer dollars in prison, remember that these convicts were usually convicted of the same ridiculous crimes mentioned in the Debt Peonage section. The labor they had to do was also very dangerous as it normally involved working in a coal mine or on a farm with little food and water. An example of just how much these people were being exploited comes with the story of John Clarke. He was convicted of “gaming,” which for him was rolling dice on the sidewalk, and was sentenced to prison for 114 days. After being leased to a coal mine, he died after being crushed by a rock just 38 days in. Now what did the coal mine do after he died? They simply bought another convict for cheap, and that is why convict leasing was so dangerous for the people who did the labor, as during the time of traditional slavery slaves were expensive, but now, they were only a few dollars, so it was more expensive to keep them in good health than it was to let them die and get a new one. This is why I said that the ending of the legal concept of slavery through the 13th amendment arguably made slavery worse.
