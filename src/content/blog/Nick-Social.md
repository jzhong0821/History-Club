The term socialism is probably one that you have heard before. Either from your history teacher, any number of dystopian novels, or used by politicians attempting to undermine left-wing policies in the US. But what exactly does it mean?

## Table of contents

## Introduction

The long story is that it depends. The word “socialism“ as we know it first appeared in the French newspaper “Le Globe” in 1832, referring to a pro-worker, egalitarian social and economic doctrine. This was far from the first time in human history that similar principles had been advocated. However, it was “The Manifesto of the Communist Party” published by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels that revolutionized the word, to resounding effects. Marx and Engels described socialism as the intermediary stage between a capitalist society, which was bound to implode due its repression of the working classes, and a communist social system in which all classes had been abolished altogether.

## An Etymological History

This brings vivid pictures of East Germany, the Soviet Union, and North Vietnam to mind. How did what was supposed to be the ultimate social organization – predicated on the promise of a more equal and just society – turn into exactly the opposite? This is because Marxist socialism was deeply flawed. In short, as exemplified in its now infamous application within a multitude of 20th century states, it enabled a government to gain dictatorial power over its people, leading to the widespread suppression of individual rights. However, the term has again shifted drastically in the modern day. Many in the US might consider Germany, Italy, the UK, Portugal, Brazil and others to be “Socialist.” This is where the term becomes convoluted.

Those “socialist” states are quite far from Socialism as imagined by Marx and Engels. In actuality, they all align along some degree of what is known as Democratic Socialism. This term encompasses systems in which some public functions are owned and there are some measures of socialized medicine and social security, but the country has a democratic system of government. In effect, it aims to achieve the positive aspects of socialism: a better livelihood for the working class, while mitigating issues posed by the totalitarian government necessary for the imposition of full-fledged Socialism.

## Conclusion

It is important to know that politically the US has always been slightly right of center, making it difficult to pass any social welfare programs that would be commonplace in Democratic Socialist countries but seen here instead as anti-capitalistic. Conservatives in the US often seem to use “Socialism” aside as a pejorative term to immediately taint liberal ideas and proposals, namely any form of economic or social interventionism.

And it works. Many in the US, even you, might see “Socialism” and feel immediately repulsed by the label. But in actuality, the term in and of itself does not have a clear definition, instead comprising any number of degrees of left wing policy. Just as it would be both unfair and highly confounding for a specific word to encompass both New Labor Conservatism and Fascism, and all of the variations in between, the word “Socialism” has no business being so broad.
