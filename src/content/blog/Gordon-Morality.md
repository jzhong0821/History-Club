This article explores the intricate tapestry of human ethics, specifically focusing on the concept of morality through the contrasting perspectives of Friedrich Nietzsche and Immanuel Kant. Nietzsche, a 19th-century German philosopher and cultural critic known for challenging traditional moral values, argued that morality is a subjective human construct. In contrast, Kant, an 18th-century German philosopher and one of the central Enlightenment thinkers, asserted that morality is rooted in universal, objective principles derived from reason and rationality.

## Moral Subjectivism

Nietzsche refuted the idea of an objective moral order, arguing that morality derives neither from divine or natural law. In his eyes, morality was a human creation, subject to the biases of individual or collective perspectives. This philosophy, known as moral subjectivism, sees ethical values as reflections of personal or cultural experiences and preferences that are constantly shifting. Nietzsche's perspective questions the foundation of our moral beliefs, suggesting that what we consider 'good' or 'evil' is merely a social construct. But is the idea of morality a mere illusion?

## Moral Realism

In contrast, Immanuel Kant championed the concept of morality as grounded in human reason. He argued that a set of innate moral principles exists to be discovered through rational thought and applicable universally to all cognisant beings. From this perspective, moral laws represent inherent truths akin to axioms in mathematics. For instance, aligning with his philosophy, the claim that 'killing a defenseless person is wrong' is true in the same way that 'one plus one equals two' is true. This view, known as moral realism, asserts that objective ethical truths exist independent from and transcend human belief systems, raising the question of whether we are able to actually access these supposedly universal moral truths.

## The Role of Empathy

This debate between Nietzsche and Kant also raises questions regarding the role of empathy and human connection in forming our perception of morality. Evolutionary psychology suggests that our capacity for empathy, molded through centuries of social interaction, plays an integral role in our sense of morality and decision-making abilities. Nietzsche would have likely regarded this research as evidence of morality's subjective nature, ingrained in human emotion and personal experience. However, Kant would have likely insisted that universal rationality is its foundation.

## A Contemporary Perspective

Presently, the tension between Nietzsche's and Kant's views on morality continues to echo in ethical debates. Specifically, the emphasis on subjectivity in Nietzsche's moral philosophy appeals to the relativistic nature of modern culture, where individualism is often championed and celebrated. Kant's objective morality, on the other hand, advocates for universal ethical principles in an increasingly interconnected world. Can we find a middle ground where subjective experiences enrich our understanding of objective moral truths?

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) offers an intriguing context to apply Kant's and Nietzsche's moral philosophies. Adopting a Kantian approach when programming AI would likely involve instilling a set of firm rules and duties within the AI’s systems. This would include imperatives such as not causing harm to humans and respecting privacy, mirroring Kant's emphasis on universal and objective moral principles. Such guidelines would be based on the concept of regarding all users as ends in themselves, not as a means to an end, aligning with Kant's categorical imperative. Conversely, Nietzsche's perspective would involve the argument that the ethical frameworks we program into AI reflect the creators' subjective biases and society's moral norms. From Nietzsche’s viewpoint, these ethics are not grounded in objective moral truth but are constantly shifting and evolving based on society. This view underscores the variability of moral standards, suggesting that what AI considers moral may change as societal values change.

## Conclusion

As we conclude this exploration, the debate between Nietzsche's radical subjectivism and Kant's rational objectivism continues to echo. It challenges us to reflect on the nature of our moral beliefs and their implications for our lives. Perhaps, morality lies in the intricate interplay of both perspectives.
