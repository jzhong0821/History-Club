The Space Race: how it started, where it went, and what it taught us.

## Table of contents

## Intro

The Space Race was a competition for power during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Each country was determined to showcase its technological superiority and conquer space before the other. Both countries understood the importance of space exploration as it became yet another display of dominance, so political leaders and organizations began pouring money into funding missions.

## The Start

The starting point for the race was on October 4th 1957 when “Sputnik,” the first artificial satellite, was launched into space by the Soviet Union and was able to send radio signals back to earth for three weeks until its batteries ran out. This notable accomplishment had a significant effect on both countries’ national agendas. Additionally, the possibilities that “Sputnik” offered were unchartered territory which incited fear across the world.

Just one month later, on November 3rd 1957, the first live organism, a dog named Laika, was launched into space aboard “Sputnik II”. The trip was planned to be one way and the Soviets designed the mission to learn more about the effects of the conditions of space on animals.

## Developments

President Dwight Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act in July 1958, which led to the formation of the first national agency committed to American space exploration. NASA was created in response to the U.S President’s concern with the speedy success of the Soviet’s Space program.

In 1959, the US launched the world’s first weather satellite, which obtained the first pictures of Earth from Space. In this same year, the USSR launched “Luna 2” and “Luna 3,”, the latter of which succeeded in orbiting the moon and photographing its far side.

April 12th 1961 was the day that Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space and also the first person to orbit the Earth aboard “Vostok 1.” The most outstanding part of his expedition is that he was able to safely return to earth after his one hour and forty eight minute flight. This was a momentous victory for the Soviets and a crushing blow for NASA scientists.

During a joint session of Congress, President John Kennedy pledged to have an American astronaut walk on the moon by the end of the decade: a direct response to American fears of Soviet victories in space.

Four days after the Apollo 11 launch on 20th July 1969, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Almoon and Michael Collins fulfilled Kennedy’s promise and landed on the moon. Its television broadcast was witnessed by an estimated 650 million people around the world. This secured a huge victory for America in the Space Race.

## The End

Arguably, the Space Race came to an end with the establishment of the Apollo-Soyuz Project in 1975: a joint mission between these American and Russian spacecrafts while in orbit. The two docked in space, and the first international handshake was exchanged by their commanders: Tom Staffford and Alexei Leonov. This gesture symbolized the end of the Space Race and prepared the world for future collaborative missions, such as the International Space Station.

## Conclusion

Looking back, this collective endeavor has had considerable political, scientific, and technological impacts that can be felt to this day. It laid the groundwork for international collaboration in space exploration, and it was a pivotal period in the history of space exploration.
