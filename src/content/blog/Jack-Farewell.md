## It’s morning at Stevenson.

As the election season comes to an end at RLS, I am glad to say that, at the very least, **I have had a lot of fun.** The JZ25 campaign was by its nature a call for freedom of expression, that when it comes to normal campus affairs, students should be allowed to publicly discuss and disagree with school officials in accordance with the RLS core values. As we start to enter early summer, campus has been enveloped in warmth, and a new sense of conviction has begun to shine through from the student body.

I have spoken on this many times, but I want to say it again. Stevenson School is a private institution and has no **_legal obligation_** to provide students with any degree of freedom of speech. However, as an American school, Stevenson has a **_moral obligation_** to educate the next generation of democratic voters, and it is simply against its basic principle of "inclusion" to censor campus discussions on basic topics: assemblies, LC backdoor, DEI changes.

## We have had a history

We have had a history of silencing public dialogue. This is a truth, and I still find it baffling how, while trying to promote knowledge on civic engagement during symposiums, we have witnessed the active suppression of student activism on the most trivial of campus affairs.

Stevenson should be a place where debate is celebrated, where public disagreement is allowed, not where every public conversation leads to a private conversation with the Student Life Office, and that private conversation turns into an informal interrogation session. I believe that my campaign has had an overall positive effect by giving students the courage to speak up. When a topic truly matters to you, you should be brave enough to speak about it.

Community engagement in a school environment does not come from being part of StuCo, DEI, or RAC. Non-official-organization members still have a **right and responsibility** to speak out for their truth. I have witnessed large amounts of criticism that Stevenson lacks proper and passionate school spirit, but school spirit comes from genuine pride and expression; it is simply impossible to have real school spirit without the right to speak freely about basic campus affairs.

## The great danger of Stevenson’s transformation

The great danger of Stevenson’s transformation is that students may become bored of talking just as the school opens its ears.

The fight is not over. The shutting down of assembly speakers, the metastasis of administrative bloat, and ideological bias in the school community are living realities, not distant memories. Stevenson students must remain vigilant, continuing to call out these pathologies and push for genuine reform. Yet even as we criticize, we should also recognize the opportunity: the school is listening. These moments of openness are rare, and it must be met with clarity, courage, and seriousness of purpose.

## Farewell

As approach speech day, and as I wrap up my last statements as a JZ25 presidential candidate, returning back to my status as a normal Stevenson student, I want to acknowledge that I have still faced a fair amount of traction while running the JZ25 campaign. I have had my posters ripped off many times, I have been insulted personally by faculty members, I have been insulted personally by my peers, but I have also gained an unexpectedly significant amount of support in my quest for bettering the campus.

Thank you for your support, I hope you had as much fun as I have.
