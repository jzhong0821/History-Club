The disdain Flik's dining service has faced is unwarranted. Upholding the high moral standards of a Stevenson student, I feel compelled to present the truth to all.

## Table of contents

## Introduction

At Stevenson School of Pebble Beach, California, there has been a prevailing sentiment, whether out of active criticism or passive conformity, regarding the Flik Dining Services, our dining service provider. Numerous concerns have been voiced by students. Despite this disapproval, it is clear that Flik has been consistently making efforts to improve.

<u>To understand the current state of FLIK’s reputation in the Stevenson community, we must begin by examining its reforms made in response to past criticisms</u>.

## Criticism to Flik

Since Dr. Dan Griffiths became school principal, his commitment to elevating the school dining experience is evident, as underscored in an email sent to the entire Stevenson Community last year, titled “_Updates on Flik dining services survey_.”

This email reveals that a survey all students and faculty members took gave Flik Dining Service an overall score of **3.1 out of 5** in terms of general performance during the 2022-2023 school year – a score neither exemplary, nor unspeakably low.

Following this outcome, the Flik Dining team held a meeting discussing 3 main demands reflected in the survey: improved food taste, more variety in vegetarian offerings, and greater variety in beverage offerings.

### Food Taste

- The first demand, and most apparent, is an improvement in food taste. The food offering last year is rightfully criticized for not following traditional recipes and simply not tasting that good. However, since then, Flik has made several improvements, most notably seen from their performance the week before family weekend. May I read to you this menu for main dinner dishes from Monday through Friday: signature cheeseburger, over fried chicken, grilled strip steak, chicken spinach lasagna, beef bulgogi. Additionally, Flik probably noticed how popular Horchata was last year, providing it more frequently this year during lunch and dinner. All these are evidence of Flik striving for the better, but, sadly, this effort has rarely been recognized.

### Vegan-friendliness

- The second point of contention was the need for more vegan options. Honestly, I never really noticed how Flik managed this aspect of the dining experience last year as a meat-eater myself. However, this year presents a notable attempt. Every lunch and dinner menu now features at least one vegan alternative to the primary dish or protein. Granted, the veggie chicken nuggets may have been featured more times than ideal, but the intention behind Flik's endeavors is clear.

### Lack of Variety

- Finally, while it is undeniable that Flik does lack some variety when it comes to food and beverages -- the same menu repeats itself every once in a while, and there are only that many drink options, which was made even worse as one of the juice machines broke down recently -- this is not a dilemma with immediate solutions. Flik's commendable efforts, especially during Monday night dinners this year, serve as clear evidence for their determination to evolve. Given this, I propose we afford Flik another opportunity to prove themselves.

## Conclusion

It’s true: Flik is not perfect. There are several inherent risks overhauling which might jeopardize the existing framework: constantly long lines when popular items are served, lack of variety in protein options at the sandwich bar, and, most importantly, an absence of **THE REAL** Sriracha sauce.

Yet these constant comparisons to an optimal dining service, which will likely never exist, inhibit us from recognizing the Flik’s many good qualities and constant improvement. Even worse, this bitter mindset prevents us from identifying the proper reforms that could actually improve our situation. Only by accepting reality can we institute real improvements to Flik Dining Services.
