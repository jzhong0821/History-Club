## Introduction

Slavery is a complex and damaging issue with effects that linger even to today. Yet the true fates of the freed slaves of the Civil War remain unknown to the general population.

## The Myth of the Civil War Ending Slavery

The pervasive idea is that the Civil War ended slavery in the United States with the enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. However, the large corporations still in need of cheap labor found ways to turn the system in their favor and, arguably, have made matters worse for the Black population.

## Debt Peonage

One of the more roundabout ways corporations could do this was through debt peonage, a system in which a person would be arrested, taken to court, and convicted. Then, if the punishment for their crime only involved a fine, they could pay off their debt through working for the suing corporation.

This doesn’t sound too exploitative, but many people found ways to manipulate the system through the use of unfair contracts and convicting people – who were typically Black – of phony crimes. An example of such charges would be vagrancy, meaning lack of employment.

Furthermore, during the time that the convict is working for whichever corporation got them to sign the contract, all the food and housing they’re getting is being added back into their debt. This means that combined with the very low wages, a person with a contract such as this would probably spend the rest of their life working, all because of a ridiculous crime.

## Sharecropping

If you are thinking this sounds like sharecropping you would be correct. Sharecropping involved someone working on a farm, and their work would not pay for their needs, which usually made them fall into debt; or, if that was not the case, they were left with minimal amounts of residual income.

The biggest difference between a contract of debt peonage and sharecropping is that a sharecropper could leave and agree to pay off their debts while the debt peon could not do so.

## Convict Leasing

In the years following the Civil War, many companies that had relied on slavery were having a difficult time surviving, so they worked out agreements with prisons through a system known as convict leasing. This would be where a convict, instead of serving their sentence in prison, would be leased out to work to anyone that wanted them.

If it seems acceptable for a convict to do labor as opposed to using up taxpayer dollars in prison, remember that these convicts were usually convicted of the sham crimes mentioned above. The labor they had to do was also very dangerous as it normally involved working in a coal mine or on a farm lacking sufficient food or water. An example of the extent to which these people were being exploited comes from the story of John Clarke. Convicted of “gaming” – rolling dice on a sidewalk – he was sentenced to prison for 114 days. After being leased to a coal mine, he died after being crushed by a rock after 38 days.

What did the coal mine do after he died? It acquired another convict for cheap. This epitomizes the danger of convict leasing to those performing the labor. In some aspects, a victim of convict leasing was valued to an even lesser extent than an enslaved person would have been, due to the former being drastically less expensive. This is why the “ending of slavery” simply made enslavement worse.
