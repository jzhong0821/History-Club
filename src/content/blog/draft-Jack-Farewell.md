## It’s morning at Stevenson.

No matter the result, I am glad to say that, at the very least, **I have had a lot of fun with JZ25.**

The JZ25 campaign was by its nature a call for freedom of expression, that when it comes to normal campus affairs, students should be allowed to publicly discuss and disagree with school policies. As we start to enter early summer, campus has been enveloped in warmth, and a new sense of conviction has begun to shine through from the student body.

I have spoken on this many times, but I want to say it again. Stevenson School is a private institution and has no **_legal obligation_** to provide students with any degree of freedom of speech. However, as an American school, Stevenson has a **_moral obligation_** to educate the next generation of democratic voters.

## We have had a history

We have had a history of underrepresented public dialogue. This is a truth. I assume no harmful intentions from the school's end, but students with contrarian ideals have felt their voices oppressed in the past, and this needs to be addressed.

Stevenson should be a place where debate is celebrated, where public disagreement is allowed. I believe that my campaign has had an overall positive effect by giving students the courage to speak up. When a topic truly matters to you, you should be brave enough to speak about it.

Community engagement in a school environment does not come from being part of StuCo, DEI, or RAC. Non-official-organization members still have a **right and responsibility** to speak out for their truth. I have witnessed large amounts of criticism that Stevenson lacks proper and passionate school spirit, but school spirit comes from genuine pride and expression; it is simply impossible to have real school spirit without the students who are willing to speak freely about basic campus affairs.

## Moving forward

The danger of Stevenson’s transformation is that students may become bored of talking just as the school opens its ears. The fight is not over, but we should also recognize the opportunity: the school is listening.

There is an active attempt from the administration to take in active student feedback, and these moments of openness are rare. Moments like this must be met with clarity, courage, and seriousness of purpose.

## Farewell

As I wrap up my last statements as a JZ25 presidential candidate, returning back to my status as a Stevenson student, I want to thank all the support I have had through the running process. To all my followers on Instagram, and you all who cheered during my speech, I hope you had as much fun as I have.
