The term socialism is probably one that you have heard before. Either from your history teacher, any number of dystopian novels, or used by politicians attempting to undermine left-wing policies in the US. However, what exactly does it mean?

## Introduction

The long story is that it depends. The word Socialism first appeared in the French newspaper “Le Globe” in 1832, referring to a pro-worker, egalitarian societal and economic doctrine. This, however, was far from the first time in human history that Socialist principles had been advocated for. However in the 1852 manuscript “The Manifesto of the Communist Party,” Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels revolutionized the word, the effects of which have been resounding. Marx and Engels described socialism as the intermediary between a capitalist society which was bound to implode due its innate repression of the working classes, and utopian communism where all classes had been abolished altogether.

## An Etymological History

This brings vivid pictures of East Germany, the Soviet Union, and North Vietnam to mind. How did what was supposed to be the ultimate social organization – predicated on the promise of a more equal and just society – turn into exactly the opposite? This is because Marxist Socialism was deeply flawed. I will save how it is flawed for another day, because it deserves an article of its own, but boy was it flawed.

However, the term has again shifted drastically when looking at the modern day. Many in the US might consider Germany, Italy, The UK, Portugal, Brazil and others to be “Socialist”. This is where the term gets pretty sticky, though.

Those “Socialist” states are quite far from Socialism. In actuality, they all align along some degree of what is known as Democratic Socialism. This “Socialism” is really not Socialism, at least compared to its historical definition. Democratic Socialism encompasses a system in which some public functions are owned, and where there are some measures of socialized medicine and social security, but the country has a democratic system of government. In effect, attempting to achieve the good parts of Socialism: a better livelihood for the working class, without the authoritarianism part.

## Conclusion

It is important to know that the US politically has historically always been slightly right of center, making it difficult to pass any social welfare programs that would be commonplace in Democratic Socialist countries, being seen instead as anti-capitalistic. Conservatives in the US oftentimes seem to use Socialism as a pejorative term to immediately taint liberal ideas and proposals, namely any form of economic interventionism.

And it works: many in the US, even you, might see “Socialism” and feel immediately repulsed. But in actuality, the term in and of itself does not have a clear definition, instead it comprises any number of degrees of left wing policy. Just as it would be both unfair but also highly confounding for a specific word to encompass both New Labor Conservatism and Nazism, and all of the in-between, the word Socialism has no business being so broad.
