The Pirate Journal is a student-led publication founded and operated by the [RLS History Club](#rls-history-club).

We feature student-written nonfiction essays, and are constantly open for [submissions](#subscriptions--submissions)! It’s our mission to create an open platform for students at Stevenson with a love for writing to share their opinions.

All essays published to The Pirate Journal will be displayed on this website, [RlsHistory.Club](/).

## RLS History Club

> Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re.

In the Fall of 2023, the RLS History Club was founded by Nick Baker & Jack Zhong with help from Dr. Oster. In organizing movie screenings, speaker events, helping students prepare for the [National History Day Competition](https://nhd.org/en/), and running The Pirate Journal, the History Club aims to create a centralized community for students passionate in writing, discussing, and learning about historical and intellectual topics.

Currently, the club has over 40 active members. We hold meetings every 2 cycles for our various aforementioned activities.

If you would like to join the History Club, please [Contact Us](#contact-us) directly via email. We would love any member of Stevenson’s student body to join us!
